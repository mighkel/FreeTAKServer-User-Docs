The API allows you to easily connect third parties to the TAK family, without the need to understand the complexity of the COT structure or what a TCP connection is. FTS also supports an Internal API . How FTS manages the information FTS will send the information coming trough the API to all the connected clients, addtionally it will save it to the persistency, to be query in future. List of supported API In the current release (1.9), FTS supports following API: ManageAPI/getHelp ManageGeoObject/postGeoObject ManageGeoObject/putGeoObject ManageGeoObject/getGeoObject ManageGeoObject/getGeoObjectByZone ManageEmergency/postEmergency ManageEmergency/getEmergency ManageEmergency/deleteEmergency ManageChat/postChatToAll ManageRoute/postRoute ManagePresence/postPresence ManagePresence/putPresence ManageVideoStream/postVideoStream Sensor/postDrone Sensor/postSPI /ManageKML/postKML General Configuration To quickly test the API, you can use a browser extension like ARC Advanced rest client (Chrome). REST APIs are easy to use, however they require a minimum ammount of knowledge, we DO NOT provide support to explain WHAT an API is. Please refer to an online tutorial such as this . Endpoint The API uses the following format: VERB [Protocol]://IP:PORT/APIName/action For example: POST http://104.58.20.216:9999/manageGeoObject/postGeoObject Authorization To use the API you need to have a REST API key. The authorization is placed in the header of the message. Authorization: Bearer [YOUR_API_KEY] You need to use the string 'Bearer' before YOUR_API_KEY A valid key is generated from FTS' CLI or, since 1.4 also from the Web UI, and stored into the DB. To add an API user in the CLI type: add_api_user See CLI help for details. To create a REST API key using the Web UI, go to the User section. To consume the API you will need to request a key to your FTS admin. The following is a non-working example of a key: { \"Authorization\": \"Bearer meg@secre7apip@guesmeIfyouCan\" } Message In most end points, the message is placed in the body of the request as JSON formatted. See below for detailed examples. In the API using the Get verbs it's a variable. API Details manageAPI Set of commands relative to API management. getHelp Retrieve API version and supported endpoints. * verb: GET * endpoint: /manageAPI/getHelp * returns: json containing API version and supported endpoints getHelp Example: return data (1.9.5) {\"APIVersion\": \"1.9.5\", \"SupportedEndpoints\": [\"/ManageNotification/getNotification\", \"/ManageVideoStream/deleteVideoStream\", \"/ManageVideoStream/postVideoStream\", \"/ManageVideoStream/getVideoStream\", \"/ManageSystemUser/putSystemUser\", \"/ManageEmergency/deleteEmergency\", \"/ManageGeoObject/postGeoObject\", \"/ManageEmergency/postEmergency\", \"/ManageGeoObject/getGeoObject\", \"/ManageGeoObject/putGeoObject\", \"/ManageEmergency/getEmergency\", \"/ManagePresence/postPresence\", \"/ManagePresence/putPresence\", \"/ManageRoute/postRoute\", \"/SystemUser/deleteSystemUser\", \"/SystemUser/postSystemUser\", \"/ManageChat/postChatToAll\", \"/ManageCoT/getZoneCoT\", \"/ManageKML/postKML\", \"/manageAPI/getHelp\", \"/Sensor/postDrone\", \"/Sensor/postSPI\", \"/BroadcastDataPackage\", \"/ManageVideoStream\", \"/AuthenticateUser\", \"/DataPackageTable\", \"/ManageGeoObject\", \"/ManageEmergency\", \"/FederationTable\", \"/ManagePresence\", \"/MissionTable\", \"/ExCheckTable\", \"/SendGeoChat\", \"/ManageRoute\", \"/checkStatus\", \"/GenerateQR\", \"/ManageChat\", \"/RecentCoT\", \"/APIUser\", \"/Clients\", \"/Sensor\", \"/MapVid\", \"/Alive\", \"/URL\"]} manageGeoObject A GeoObject is an element place on a map.

Refresh your local package index first by typing: sudo apt update Then install Node.js: sudo apt install nodejs ``` Check that the install was successful by querying node for its version number: node -v ``` Output something like this v10.19.0 If the package in the repositories suits your needs, this is all you need to do to get set up with Node.js. In most cases, you\u2019ll also want to also install npm, the Node.js package manager. You can do this by installing the npm package with apt: sudo apt install npm This will allow you to install modules and packages to use with Node.js. Install NodeRed Use npm to install node-red and a helper utility called node-red-admin. sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red node-red-admin npm normally installs its packages into your current directory. Here, we use the -g flag to install packages \u2018globally\u2019 so they\u2019re placed in standard system locations such as /usr/local/bin. The --unsafe-perm flag helps us avoid some errors that can pop up when npm tries to compile native modules (modules written in a compiled language such as C or C++ vs. JavaScript). After a bit of downloading and file shuffling, you\u2019ll be returned to the normal command line prompt. Let\u2019s test our install. First, we\u2019ll need to open up a port on our firewall. Node-RED defaults to using port 1880, so let\u2019s allow that. sudo ufw allow 1880 And now launch Node-RED itself. No sudo is necessary, as port 1880 is high enough to not require root privileges. node-red Create the Service In order to start Node-RED automatically on startup, we\u2019ll need to install a node-red.service file let's creates the service using the Tee command sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/node-red.service >/dev/null << EOF Description=Node-RED After=syslog.target network.target [Service] ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node-red-pi --max-old-space-size=128 -v Restart=on-failure KillSignal=SIGINT # log output to syslog as 'node-red' SyslogIdentifier=node-red StandardOutput=syslog # non-root user to run as WorkingDirectory=/home/nodered/ User=nodered Group=nodered [Install] WantedBy=multi-user.target EOF Now that our service file is installed , we need to enable it. This will enable it to execute on startup. sudo systemctl enable node-red Let\u2019s manually start the service now to test that it\u2019s still working. sudo systemctl start node-red ``` to shut it back down you can use sudo systemctl stop node-red ## test your installation Point a browser back at the server\u2019s port 1880 and verify that Node-RED is back up. e.g. if your server is installed under the IP 143.198.39.135 ``` browser http://143.198.39.135:1880/ you will see the welcome screen of NodeRed with the tutorial Now, to install the flows, click on the hanburger menu and then import download one of the FreeTAKHub integrations (json files) import into your Nodered resolve any conflict by importing additional nodes in you palette Success!!!!","title":"FreeTAKHub NodeRed"},{"location":"FreeTAKHub/Integration/NodeRedinstallation/#freetakhub-nodered","text":"there are several ways to install NodeRed. - Install Using Script (simple) - Install using APT (advanced Users)","title":"FreeTAKHub NodeRed"},{"location":"FreeTAKHub/Integration/NodeRedinstallation/#install-using-script-simple","text":"the following script will do Installing and Upgrading Node-RED to install Node.js, npm and Node-RED onto a Ubuntu Raspberry Pi.

FTS supports SSL since version 1.3. Automated SSL Generation and Deployment Since version 1.5, FTS features automated SSL generation and deployment. The automated generation and deployment is easier, please consider using that approach. For more details, read the FTS manual here . Expected File Structure Manual SSL Installation Guide This method requires understanding of complex console commands. We do not provide support for certificate generation or deployment issues. We are currently exploring tools like YAOG to simplify the process. Some of the steps below to create a server and client certificate are adopted from: https://blog.devolutions.net/2020/07/tutorial-how-to-generate-secure-self-signed-server-and-client-certificates-with-openssl/ 1. Install OpenSSL on Windows using the choco package manager Go to: https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup#installing-chocolatey and install the choco package manager. Next, temporarily append the choco executable to the PATH variable. After PowerShell is closed, the appended path will resort back to its original state. $env:Path += \";C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin\" To permanently add to the PATH variable, refer to: https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm Next, install OpenSSL: choco install openssl Do not close PowerShell because you will need it for the next steps. 2. Add OpenSSL to the PATH Most likely, you will be running a 64-bit system. For a 64-bit system, enter: $env:Path += \";C:\\Program Files\\OpenSSL-Win64\\bin\" For a 32-bit system (unlikely), enter: $env:Path += \";C:\\Program Files\\OpenSSL-Win32\\bin\" 3. Set up a directory for OpenSSL outputs Go to your home directory. cd ~ Make an invisible folder called .certs . mkdir .certs Go into the .certs directory. cd .certs 4. Generate the Certificate Authority Certificate Create a private key for the CA certifcate. openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out ca.key A ca.key will be outputted to the directory: Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 ca.key Next, create CA certificate from the newly created private key. openssl req -new -x509 -sha256 -key ca.key -out ca.crt You will be prompted to enter in certificate details. Here is an example: You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request. What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN. There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank For some fields there will be a default value, If you enter '.', the field will be left blank. ----- Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:CA Locality Name (eg, city) []:Los Angeles Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Acme Corporation Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Dev Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Wile E. Coyote Email Address []:wile@acmecorp.com A ca.crt will be outputted to the directory. Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 944 ca.crt -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 ca.key 5. Generate the Server Certificate Generate the server private key. openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out server.key A server.key will be outputted to the directory: Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 944 ca.crt -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 ca.key -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 server.key Next, generate the server certificate signing request. openssl req -new -sha256 -key server.key -out server.csr You will be prompted to enter in certificate details.

Generate the Client Certificate These are the same steps as above, except for the client. Generate the server private key. openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out client.key A client.key will be outputted to the directory: Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 944 ca.crt -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 ca.key -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 42 ca.srl -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 client.key -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 820 server.crt -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 382 server.csr -a---- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM 232 server.key Next, generate the client certificate signing request. openssl req -new -sha256 -key client.key -out client.csr You will be prompted to enter in certificate details.

Make sure you have JRE installed For example, install JRE8 if you do not have it installed: choco install jre8 8. Add the JRE bin folder to the PATH Go into the Java folder: cd \"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\\" Find the JRE folder: dir which will output something like: Directory: C:\\Program Files\\Java Mode LastWriteTime Length Name ---- ------------- ------ ---- d----- 11/10/1775 6:00 PM jre1.8.0_311 Go into the JRE folder: NOTE: Your JRE may be a different version cd jre1.8.0_311 Go into the bin directory: cd bin Output the absolute path of this directory: pwd which will output out something like: Path ---- C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_311\\bin Add this directory to the PATH: $env:Path += \";C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_311\\bin\" Now go back to your .certs folder: cd ~\\.certs\\ 9. Generate the keystore Enter this command to generate the keystore: keytool -genkey -v -keystore fts.keystore -alias fts -storetype PKCS12 -keyalg RSA -sigalg SHA256withRSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 You will be prompted to enter in keystore details.
